# Fuel Cell Laboratory Operations & LIMS

> 燃料电池实验室运营与 LIMS

A traceable laboratory operations system for equipment, experiments, samples, reagents, calibration, maintenance, inventory, safety, and quality records.

## Product modules

- Equipment registry, calibration, and maintenance schedules
- Experiment plans, runs, samples, and electronic lab records
- Reagent and consumable inventory with lot/expiry tracking
- SOPs, safety checks, incidents, and training records
- Result capture, attachments, and review/approval workflow
- Dashboards, exports, and complete audit history

## Engineering principles

Track who/when/source for every critical record. Separate planned, measured, imported, and demo data. Enforce units, calibration status, expiry checks, and review gates.

- Modular, typed, documented code; no monolithic application entry point.
- Reproducible setup, deterministic tests, and automated quality checks.
- Secure configuration: secrets belong in environment variables or managed secret stores, never in source control.
- Accessible, responsive interface with clear loading, empty, error, and offline states.
- Open-source components are evaluated for maintenance, license compatibility, security, and fit before adoption.

## Rebuild status

The rebuild/platform-v2 branch is the new implementation track. The existing main branch remains unchanged during development. This repository is not considered rebuilt until the implementation, tests, documentation, and deployment path have been verified.

See [the rebuild plan](docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md).
